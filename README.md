### Install and build

We need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to build the parser because we use [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/), which is a Java program. So, at first, install a JVM on your system.

In a terminal, open the cloned `typeonly/` repository. Then:

```sh
# Download once the ANTLR JAR file in the project's root directory
wget https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar

# Install once all Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Development environment

With VS Code, our recommanded plugins are:

- **ANTLR4 grammar syntax support** from Mike Lischke (`mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4`)
- **Todo Tree** from Gruntfuggly (`gruntfuggly.todo-tree`)
- **TSLint** from Microsoft (`ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin`)
